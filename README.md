**Machine Learning for Price Prediction (Linear Regression)**

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **machine learning (linear regression)** to analyze a dataset of used and refurbished devices and build a predictive model that supports a **dynamic pricing strategy**.

The objective is to identify the factors that significantly influence device prices and to use a regression-based machine learning model to predict price based on device characteristics.

The project combines exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, and supervised machine learning to translate data into actionable business insights.
